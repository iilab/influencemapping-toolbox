description2: K-Monitor is an anti-corruption grass root NGO founded in 2007. K-Monitor
  strives against corruption and promotes the transparency of public spending in Hungary.
  K-Monitor operates open data websites, conducts research and advocates for legal
  reform.  With the contribution of our researches, analyses and recommendations,
  we aim to challenge and overcome the social indifference to corruption, to raise
  awareness and disseminate knowledge. We truly believe that information technology
  can contribute to a more open, more transparent and more democratic way of governing.
  Therefore K-Monitor develops databases and online tools by which public expenses
  become trackable, and decision makers can be hold accountable.
