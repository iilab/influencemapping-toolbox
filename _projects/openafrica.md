description2: openAFRICA aims to be largest independent repository of open data on
  the African continent. openAFRICA is not a government portal. It is instead a grassroots
  initiative, maintained by Code for Africa as a public service. The platform is therefore
  available as a free resource for ordinary citizens, civil society organisations,
  civic activists, the media, and government agencies.
