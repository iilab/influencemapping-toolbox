description2: Party Time documents the political fundraising circuit. From the early
  morning hours until late at night, there are opportunities for members of Congress,
  presidential and congressional candidates to meet with supporters behind closed
  doors, press them for money and party. Breakfasts, luncheons, barbecues, golfing
  outings, receptions, concerts, basketball, baseball, footballâ€”the social whirl is
  endless.
