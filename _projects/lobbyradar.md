approach_how: Lobbyradar mapped the network of connections between industrial lobbies
  and German politicians. It also supplies a plugin that alerts the user whenever
  a page contains any name or information about an actor or entity in their database
  so that users (and voters) can be more knowledgeabe about a politician or a company.
