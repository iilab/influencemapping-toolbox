## Description

_Summary of the project and its approach_

__A social network analysis of lobby organizations and commissioners, cabinet members and directors-general that have met at least twice between December and July. Lobbyists who appear in a star structure were invited to several meetings as a group. Commission officials and organizations at the center of the network were in touch with a wider network of policy-makers and influencers.__
