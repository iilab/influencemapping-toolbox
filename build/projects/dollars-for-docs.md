## Description

_Summary of the project and its approach_

__Pharmaceutical and medical device companies are now required by law to release details of their payments to a variety of doctors and U.S. teaching hospitals for promotional talks, research and consulting, among other categories. ProPublica are turning this information into an easy-to-use database, in website and app form, so that patients can quickly discover the payments made to their doctor.__


Approach (How?)
:   ProPublica use details of payments disclosed under the under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and have created from them a series of databases to allow patients to see whether their doctor receives funds from drug and medical device companies. Historic data is archived and remains available.
