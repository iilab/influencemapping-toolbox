## Description

_Summary of the project and its approach_

__The Guardian is counting the people killed by US law enforcement agencies this year.__


Approach (How?)
:   The Guardian reporters and analysts indexed the number of killings by the police and gathered statistical information such as race, state but also the names of the victimes, The Guardian is now building -- with the help of Internet users who can submit a tip-- the very first database of all the killings and indirect casualties committed by the police in the US.
