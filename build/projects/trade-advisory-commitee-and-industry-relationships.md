## Description

_Summary of the project and its approach_

__The Obama administration&#39;s corporate-heavy network of official trade 
advisers has emerged as a point of sharp contention in a process that 
has been criticized by members of Congress and others as low on public 
transparency. __


Approach (How?)
:   Through a visualization of the network of the Trade office advisers working within the Obama administration, this project draws attention on the corporate interests that might influence the Trade Advisory Commitee&#39;s decisions and orientations.
