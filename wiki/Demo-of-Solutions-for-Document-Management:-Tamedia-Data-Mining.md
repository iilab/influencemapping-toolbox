* 3k employees + 1 million revenue + media corporation in dif. regional, national media, including magazines
* Offshore leaks w/ICIJ
* Sth easy to input, that extracts the entities, “intelligently”
* 60 input languages (using ABBY Api) that gets translated to german, english and french
* Find an advantage to work closely with journalists, because they are able to motivate them to share and also they can avoid bad data behavior
* 3 scenarios / (Missing)

Workflow / focus on acquisition of data. Very early stage. 

Process: 

	Google > Abby > Systran > Expert ststem - Temis

		tesseract-ocr -> Translator ^

Trying to develop a good feedback tool, not a tool, that inputs the data. About 30 formats.

The platform shows you:
Information filtered by: people, organization, data publishing date, phone numbers, currencies +
You can filter the results by clipboard, maps, hot topics +
Plus, set up alerts

**Situation 1**: automatization / works very well, but needs improvements

**Situation 2**: Entity extraction 

**Situation 3**: Live monitoring / Not so much for IJ, but pays the bills

**Situation 4**: Document storing, not collaborative (PAPER). Scanning, available for everyone in the organization.

Prototype running now, thinking about spending 1.5 million Euros.
For the time the tool has 20 users, plan in a year to have 150 users. Tamedia plans to eventually have 500 users.
