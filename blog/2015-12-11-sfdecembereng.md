<p style="text-align: left;">Next Friday 18th, the team behind the recently launched <a href="http://narcodata.animalpolitico.com/">NarcoData</a> will be talking about their project around organized crime and drug trafficking in Mexico.</p>

“The Mexican state has failed in giving its citizens accurate, updated, and systematic information about the fight against organized crime,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/wikiramos">Dulce Ramos</a>, editor-in-chief of the Mexican digital news site Animal Politico and the General coordinator for NarcoData to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/10/narcodata-is-a-new-collaboration-that-aims-to-track-and-visualize-the-drug-cartels-of-mexico/" target="_blank">Nieman Lab</a>. “NarcoData wants to fill that empty space.” NarcoData is a collaboration between <a href="http://www.animalpolitico.com/">Animal Politico</a> and data journalism platform <a href="http://www.poderopedia.org/">Poderopedia</a>.

On the other hand, <a href="http://influencemapping.org/people/">Friedrich Lindenberg</a> will be talking about the prototype of the <a href="http://pudo.org/material/opennames/">dataset that combines </a><strong><a href="http://pudo.org/material/opennames/">names and details for persons and entities of interest</a>. </strong>Such entities include political leaders as well as entities sanctioned by various governemnts (e.g. connected to criminal and terrorist activity), or those barred from public procurement.

<strong>Why would this be useful?</strong>

Let's say you are working as a journalist and you have received a leaked database, a document stash or a fresh open data release that you'd like to dig through. The next question is: what are you going to search for? This dataset gives a possible answer: by cross-referencing with sanctions lists and names of political leaders you can produce leads, which you can then check for political and criminal relevance.
