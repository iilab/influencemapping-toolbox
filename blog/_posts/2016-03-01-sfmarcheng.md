<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Tuesday 29 we’ll gather again to share projects and tools around influence mapping in a special Science Fair edition!</span>

This Science Fair we’ll be joined by <strong><a href="http://driven-by-data.net" target="_blank">Gregor Aisch</a></strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/driven_by_data" target="_blank">@driven_by_data</a>), graphics editor at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, who will <strong>*kindly*</strong> critique the visualizations of the members that would be up to present their projects/tools in the Hangout.

<strong>This is a great opportunity for all!</strong> So we encourage the influence mappers around the world to bring their visualizations and talk with Gregor about them.

Check out <a href="http://vis4.net/blog/posts/seven-features-youll-wantin-your-next-charting-tool/#more-4721" target="_blank">Gregor’s last presentation at Nicar </a>about creating charting tools and this one, about <a href="http://slides.com/drivenbydata/nicar16#/1" target="_blank">"The future of interactive news"</a>, also presented at Nicar.

This Science Fair, we’ll also meet El Universal Data, México, team. Lilia Saúl and Daniela Guazo will present their special projects: <a href="http://fideicomisos.eluniversal.com.mx" target="_blank">Las Cajas Negras del Gobierno</a> and <a href="http://data.eluniversal.com.mx/viajes-transparentes/" target="_blank">Viajes Transparentes</a>. The first one -also the first investigation for the Data team- visualizes public trust funds of the Mexican Government and <strong>Viajes Transparentes</strong> focuses on Parliamentary travels and their travel expenses.
