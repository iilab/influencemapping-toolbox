By 2012, <strong>Sébastien Heymann</strong>, CEO of <a href="http://linkurio.us/" target="_blank">Linkurious</a>, started working on a network visualization tool with the goal of expanding its use from niche, highly specialized industries. Heymann had already co-created <a href="http://gephi.github.io/" target="_blank">Gephi</a>, an interactive visualization and exploration platform for networks and complex systems, dynamic and hierarchical graphs, that was mostly used by researchers and data scientists.

“It’s paradoxical as we are more and more attuned to the networks around us but we still don’t have tools to understand them”, says <strong>Jean Villedieu</strong>, part of the Linkurious team. Now, the team has come up with a way to help businesses, investigative journalism organizations and governmental offices extract concrete insights from graphs.

Working closely with Neo Technology, the editor of <a href="http://neo4j.com/" target="_blank">Neo4j</a>, Linkurious has recently launched <a href="https://linkurio.us/announcing-linkurious-enterprise-the-first-data-visualization-platform-for-graph-databases/" target="_blank">Linkurious Enterprise</a>, the first out-of-the-box graph visualization platform for graph databases. As the team claims, the product can be used for detecting <a href="https://linkurio.us/solutions/fraud-detection/" target="_blank">fraud analysis</a><a href="https://linkurio.us/solutions/fraud-detection/" target="_blank"> and money laundering</a>, <a href="https://linkurio.us/solutions/network-management/" target="_blank">network management</a>, <a href="https://linkurio.us/solutions/knowledge-management/" target="_blank">knowledge management</a> and <a href="https://linkurio.us/solutions/intelligence-analysis/" target="_blank">competitive intelligence</a> and is already used by a few major organizations around the world, such as <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA</a>, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/CL/index.html" target="_blank">Cisco</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.es/" target="_blank">Ebay</a>, <a href="http://www.economie.gouv.fr/welcome-to-the-french-ministry-for-the-economy-and-finance" target="_blank">The French Ministry of Finances</a> and <a href="http://www.icij.org/" target="_blank">The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)</a>.

Apart from big data technologies, such as Neo4j and Elasticsearch, the team uses <a href="https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki" target="_blank">linkurious.js</a>, their own JS graph visualization toolkit for graph visualization. It has an open-source license, high performances and a plugin-like architecture (download it <a href="https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>).

<strong>Product and user research</strong>
Users such as business analysts, data journalists or researchers can collaborate on visualizations and explore their large datasets easily via a web browser, and analyse graph data in a safe and collaborative way.

As for the product they’ve accomplished so far, they’ve focused on lean user research methods: “We apply a <strong>lean method to discover user needs</strong>, which involves conducting interviews and shipping features early. We had enough user feedback with the last Linkurious version to do a complete redesign of the user experience in a unified interface. This was a difficult challenge as we decided to make Linkurious a platform for multiple users instead of a single-user tool: we added many new features -export data, find shortest path, publish visualization, security, data entry, save visualization and filtering- while keeping the most important ones easily accessible. We still have a lot to do but it’s a great joy to see users happy to migrate to the last version” explains Heymann.

<strong>Use cases in Influence Mapping community</strong>
The <strong>International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</strong> worked with Linkurious’s tool to investigate the <strong>“<a href="http://www.swissleaksreviewed.org/" target="_blank">Swiss Leaks</a>”</strong>, the analysis of around 60 thousand leaked files that provided details on HSBC’s clients and their bank accounts to bring to light a tax evasion scheme. This investigation revealed how the bank <a href="https://linkurio.us/how-the-icij-used-linkurious-to-reveal-the-secrets-hidden-in-the-swiss-leaks-data/" target="_blank">profited from doing business with tax dodgers and criminals around the world, helping over 100 000 customers hide $100bn in Switzerland</a>. This year, the project was awarded with the “Investigation of the Year” <a href="http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/programmes/data-journalism-awards/" target="_blank">Data Journalism Award, given by the Global Editors Network</a>.

They’ve also worked with young journalists from AFP around drug-related crimes, <a href="http://blogs.afp.com/makingof/?post/reglements-de-comptes-a-marseille" target="_blank">a project</a> inspired by <a href="http://homicidewatch.org/">Homicide Watch</a> to learn more about the victims and their environment. Recently they’ve been <a href="https://linkurio.us/visualizing-the-influence-of-lobbies-in-europe/" target="_blank">exploring the relationships around the Transparency Register</a> -set up by the European Union- to understand more about the influence of lobbies on policy making.
