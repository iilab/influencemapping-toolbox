The <a href="http://www.poderopedia.org/poderopedia/index/chapters" target="_blank">Poderopedia</a> <strong>Map of Media and Media Ownership</strong> will be publicly announced next Thursday September 10th. The Map of Media and Media Ownership is the largest database of News Organizations, Owners and Executives of Media in Chile and Colombia.

It was developed by the team of Poderopedia in both countries, with the collaboration of the School of Journalism of <a href="http://periodismo.uahurtado.cl/" target="_blank">Universidad Alberto Hurtado</a> (Chile), <a href="http://consejoderedaccion.org/" target="_blank">Consejo de Redacción</a> and the Faculty of Communications of <a href="http://www.javeriana.edu.co/home" target="_blank">Pontificia Universidad Javeriana</a> (Colombia); and was made possible with the support of <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/" target="_blank">Open Society Foundations</a>.

The public launch will include the opening of a database with information on more than 700 media companies, between the two countries; the result of a investigation that took eight months and that included events and hackdays with media policy experts, journalists, academics, designers and programmers, in Chile and Colombia.

The Map of Media and Media Ownership is to become a reference tool with updated relevant information for public policy makers, journalists, researchers and academics, the media and advertising industries, and the general public.

The database will be <strong>free to use and download in various formats</strong>. It also includes a general report plus a series of charts, a guide on how to create media mapping projects, and the methodology used to gather all the information.

Citizens will also be able to contribute new information and updates, using the “Add Information” feature of the Media Map.

For designers, interactive graphic developers, civic programmers and data scientists who want to create new products and visualizations using the data, we include an API. And of course the application code (Django / Python) and it`s documentation, for you to reuse it (under MIT License).
