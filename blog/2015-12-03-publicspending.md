Science Fair aims to share projects, ideas and prototypes in which the Influence Mapping community is working. It addresses the challenges they are facing in their development and also in reaching their users. Our November session demonstrated that <a href="http://supplier.tenders.exposed/" target="_blank">public spending investigation is fun</a> and that there's a way to Wiki the power in Mexico.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Who’s Who Wiki, is a tool for corporate transparency in Latin America. It was developed by the <a href="http://projectpoder.org/es/" target="_blank">Project on Organizing, Development, Education, and Research (PODER)</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Who’s Who Wiki” (WWW), or Quién es Quién Wiki in Spanish, is an open data, open software platform that addresses the lack of transparency in the Latin American private sector through monitoring companies, corporate elites, and their government counterparts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tool is allows users to access corporate data that otherwise is often inaccessible, from diverse sources, countries, and languages, all concentrated in one place, in Spanish, with a rigorous research and verification methodology. An important component of this platform is that it uses <b>wiki technology, which enables user participation to collaboratively populate the database. </b>Poder's editorial team can monitor those changes, check the public source and verify the information.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Public Spending in EU, presented by Adriana Homolova (<a href="https://twitter.com/naberacka" target="_blank">@naberacka</a>)</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adriana is looking to address public spending investigation, which she believes is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>under reported mainly because the<a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/data/entries/public-spending-in-a-net" target="_blank"> “vast amount of unstandardized information makes it time consuming and complicated to investigate”</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://influencemapping.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tenders.png"><img class="wp-image-489 aligncenter" src="/assets/images/tenders.png alt="Tenders" width="837" height="618" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“And while (investigative) journalists can excel in applying qualitative methods, they are often far from excelling even in Excel". That’s why she’s working on a tool that enables journalists to analyze and visualize tendering data and look for patterns that suggest corrupt behavior in public spending. “Our tool aims to make quantitative research easy for even the least technical person”, says Adriana.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this moment, Adriana and her team are working on prototype which will be able to filter and visualize TED tendering data from as early as 1993 up until 2015. The prototype will be finished at the beginning of 2016. The user will be able to choose a market, country and a year and explore the network visualization, as well as a list of tenders. User can also choose to explore only tenders acquired by a particular company or given by a particular public body. Network visualization will provide a market overview as well as hint at suspicious patterns, such as market domination or lack of competitiveness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the extended version, journalists will be also able to map data collected by themselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Join the <a href="http://talk.tenders.exposed" target="_blank">discussion on tenders</a> and <a href="http://elvis.tenders.exposed" target="_blank">stay tuned</a> for a new tool to investigate networks of public spending!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Later this month Adriana invited the Influence Mapping community to participate in the game <a href="http://supplier.tenders.exposed/" target="_blank">“Who wants to be a supplier?”</a>, another initiative of <strong>tenders.exposed</strong>, the team that aims to make investigation into public spending sexy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To play the game, go to the website, use the lottery machine and let it chose a market, country and the year for you. Or just go to the tool, browse through CPV codes and have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a look at tenders in your country.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Did you enjoy the game? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DK9u9j_QBSskaP6ma5Fo8wQfngHANW29Ep1XYos7jTw/viewform" target="_blank">Send some feedback</a> and share it in social media!</span></p>
