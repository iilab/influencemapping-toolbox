The influence mapping toolbox project list should help you find about existing projects in your field or outside your field that can help you assess ,"You've found a good place to start! The influence mapping toolbox aims to help people learn about existing influence mapping projects, and to share learning about common practices, tools and project experiences, so that influence mapping as a practice can grow and have even more impact.

Influence mapping is at a stage now where there are many people doing similar work but, because the community is still fragmented, learning is not being shared as effectively or as widely as it could be. 

We have created a resource where the varied expertise and in-depth knowledge of influence mappers can be shared and built upon: a toolbox that will help newcomers and experts to map influence and make the most of their work. 

There are a number of aspects you need to think about before you start your project. But planning is often a continuous and iterative process so we recommend to come back to this section and the questions within it regularly as you progress.

In this section we'll be looking at project design, important ethical considerations, the different skillsets you might need and strategy."

### Why and What? Vision and Goals

It's important to express what your current goals are for the project. This might change over the course of the project, and might evolve from being very ambitiously framed (""save the world"") to much more tightly defined. Here are a few more examples of well defined project aims:
 - [OpenCorporates](http://opencorporates.com) exists to make information about companies and the corporate world more accessible, more discoverable, and more usable, and thus give citizens, community groups, journalists, other companies, and society as a whole the ability to understand, monitor and regulate them.
 - [Lobbyradar](case_studies/lobbyradar.html) uncovers the lobbying groups and private interests in German politics.
 -[Cargografias](case_studies/cargografias.html) fosters transparency in Argentinian politics, helps citizens to get a full picture of the political history of the presidential candidates and members of the government in Argentina, and thus make decisions based on these facts.

Formulating your goals and vision helps you communicate your project to others, helps you develop links across communities and also helps you and your team keep your focus. This content can also be useful for fundraising, partnership building, communication on your website or social media as well as recruitment. It's particularly important to be clear on your aims versus how you want to achieve them if you are applying for funding for your project or writing a business plan. The next section explore how you might go about achieving your aims.

> Stop! If you haven't written down what you're trying to achieve with your project, it's time to take the time to formulate your aims and ""put them on paper"".

### How? Approach and Methodology

Now that you have clearly expressed your goal, you also need to express how you're going to get there. Different sectors will call this differently, for instance theory of change, approach, methodology or business plan. 

It's useful to first formulate a top level description of how you will achieve your project's aims. Try to keep it to one sentence:
 - [OpenCorporates](http://opencorporates.com) aims to do a straightforward (though big) thing: have a URL for every company in the world. 
 - [Lobbyradar](case_studies/lobbyradar.html) enables users to explore network visualisations that show links between institutions and people of influence within the german political sphere.
 - [Cargografias](case_studies/cargografias.html) allows you to explore the timelines of the electoral mandates of the Argentinian representatives.

Bear in mind that this probably will change over time. While you explore a particular approach, you might discover or stumble upon another more impactful or more achievable way to attain your goals.

In this section we will be discussing methods and approaches you can use to implement your influence mapping project. If you will build software you might use agile or waterfall methodologies. When considering design and user experience you might choose participatory or top-down approaches. If there's a research aspect to your project, you might be adopting action research or comparative research. In other sections we address specific methodologies for collecting, organising and publishing your data. 

The methodologies that we discuss here cut across data collection, organisation and publishing. Important methodological areas for influence mapping include methodologies that impact on the usability of data - your design methodologies, those that impact how you'll build software...

Collect,Get Started,There's a lot of data out there asking the right questions and knowing when you need to organise your own data collection takes experience.,Collecting Data,Asking the right questions to get the right data,One of the first things to address around data collection is what your question is or what is the story you're trying to tell. This will determine which data you need. Data collection could have an impact beyond the objectives of your story and it's always important to consider the ethical aspect of your data collection before you start (refer to the [Plan > Ethics section](../plan/ethics.html)). ,"### Where does your data come from?

How you collect your data will depend on whether you source primary data: data you will collect yourself, secondary data: which you're collecting from external sources, or both.

One of the key questions when sourcing data externally, is how to [discover the right data](find-data-sources.html) sources and check if they are right for you.

If you're going to collect data yourself, you'll need to think about:
How will you [collect data](collect-data.html)? Through interviews, surveys, using online tools…

Whether you collect your own data or get it from an external source, you'll need to think about:
 - How will you [clean up the data](clean-data.html) into a format that's usable for your purpose?
 - How will you [verify and control the quality of the data](verify-data.html)?"
Collect,Find Data Sources,,Collecting Data,Find good data sources,,"Web search engines are a natural first go to point in order to identify data sets, or leads that will point to data sources that might not be published.

There are specialised data catalogue engines that might list data sources relevant to a particular industry or sector (such as the [Data Catalogs](datacatalogs.org) site) to specific countries or cities (such as the UK or US national open data portals) or sources tailored to specific professionals (Investigative Dashboard for investigative journalists, or Academic Journals for researchers). 

Also some influence mapping projects in this toolbox have data available for export. These might be good sources for your work.

Collect,Collect Data,,Collecting Data,Organise the collection of data,,"One-off data collection projects are very different from longer term, ongoing data collection strategies. If your project is a one-off, it might be sufficient to organise a single collection effort, if not, then it's important to consider the frequency of your collection effort, its cost and the practicalities of the collection workflow.

Different methods work best in different contexts and for different questions. In addition, different methods have different costs and maintenance considerations. Pick your collection methods carefully (interviews, surveys, using online tools…) depending on which are most appropriate for your project. 

Sometimes it is best to start collecting data right away, so that you can get an idea of what the real data looks like. This can inform your data collection strategy as you progress with your project.

Collect,Verify Data,,Collecting Data,Checking your data quality,,"Verification can happen at various levels and is an iterative process. Authority and reputation of sources can play a part, but it's important to decide whether your data needs corroboration or triangulation (which is where you verify data by comparing three separate sources). 

If your data sources are themselves compiled and processed from different sources, provenance and traceability become an issue. Verification of external sources will make your workflow heavier and increase costs but may be necessary to maintain good data quality.

"
Organise,Model Data,,Organising Data,How to choose a model to organise your data,,"### What is data modelling? 

Data modelling is about how you structure your database. A simple example would be deciding which columns you would use in a spreadsheet, the different sheets and how you link between them. Below we discuss data modelling in more depth, but a word of warning - data modelling is a complicated field and if you have no prior experience it’s a good idea to talk to an expert before embarking on data modelling yourself.

### Why model your data?

Your model is the structure through which you can ask what relations there are between different aspects of the data. It requires choice over how you categorise the data - into what buckets you decide to put data with certain characteristics, and how you allow those categories to relate to each other. What you can find out about your data set depends on how you group together certain elements of the data. Making the right choice at the beginning will save you a lot of work in the long run.

### How to do it

With your model you want to create a structure that reflects the real life system that the data is about. Organising your data goes hand in hand with data collection. If the “rules” of the model don’t accommodate the data you’re collecting, it can require you to “break” your model, or to start over. Say you’re studying a corporate structure, and you create a data model that lists an individual’s name against their job title.  If your data model is set up to  reference only one job for a particular person, when you come to Anthony Hu who is the Events Coordinator and Accounts Assistant, you won't be able to capture this without ""breaking"" your data model - you might create duplicate rows which would lead to duplicate Anthonys. Building on this example, if you wanted to also consider the dates between which someone held a job, you should structure your data model to make this data accessible. In that case you could add a separate sheet to hold the job's data and the start and end dates. You would also want to add an identifier for each job that links it to the person in your other sheet. 

### Choosing the right type of model for you

This process is the basis of most data modeling, and specifically relational databases. Relational databases are very common, but relational data models can be tricky to modify. There are other types of data modeling techniques that are best for different cases, such as document databases - which are more flexible - and graph databases - which are suited to particular types of queries. 

One key decision for an influence mapping project is how relationship between people and organisations or other type groups are modeled. For a large majority of cases, a simple relational model will be sufficient. Graph data models and databases are more rarely needed, for specific types of queries such as discovering paths in relations or calculating a social graphs' mathematical characteristics - such as centrality or betweenness. There is an extra cost and effort related to using these types of structures because experts are harder to find and the tools are less mature.

Perhaps the most sophisticated and difficult type of data models you can use are based on the semantic web approach. It allows to describe data in a lot of detail and with a lot of flexibility which can be useful to describe complex systems. Using such data models in practice is however cumbersome and only well resourced projects with semantic web experts should attempt to go this route.

Data models should be only as sophisticated as they need to be to answer your project’s questions. It can be tempting to try to capture everything with your data model, but over-engineering your data model will affect how practicable your project is. Adding too many variables and types of entities and relations can result in making the data collection and clean up process much longer, as well as make the development of queries and applications more challenging.

### How responsive do you need your queries to be?

Database query times can vary from almost instantaneous to several days, so it’s important to consider performance as part of your project plan. If you’re hoping to make an interactive interface to your data that others will use, for instance, then your queries need to happen without a time lag for it to be useable.

Performance can be affected by your choice of database type will as will the details of your data model. Your choice of data model will also influence whether or not the data and the queries can be distributed on a large number of computers in order to make the queries faster. As performance is controlled by multiple factors you might want to consider discussing this with a data modelling expert before making your choice. 

The data you collect and how you’re going to use your database also impacts on performance. Different query types vary in the time needed to return results. You might want to look up a particular data point (""Who was system administrator of this organisation between 2012 and 2014?""), do a text search (""Find all jobs with 'Administrator' in the title"") or carry out  numerical analysis (""What is the average length of time that a system administrator will stay at her job?""). Similarly, if you're looking at only one company with hundreds of employees it will be quicker than an equivalent search through a data set for an entire country with historical data for tens of years
