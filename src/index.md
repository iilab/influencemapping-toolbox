#Are you an influence mapper?
__You could be an influence mapper and not even know it yet.__

Influence mapping is about making impact. It can be about finding things out - revealing secrets, discovering a story. It can be about getting the word out, telling a story, or even generating evidence that can be used in a legal process. Or it can be about making tools and databases that make doing all that easier.

Influence mapping projects aim to hold those in power accountable for their decisions. It is a process that allows citizens to have oversight on governments, organisations and corporations. While influence mappers use varied methods and create tools to help find evidence, stories and make visualisations, they share motivations and practices. 

Find out more by reading this [state of the art report on influence mapping](assets/influencemapping_soa_dec15_web.pdf).

Between data journalism, network visualisation, political science and activism, influence mapping is still building an identity as a practice in its own right. Influence mapping is emerging and the community is growing.
