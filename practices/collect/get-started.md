### [Practices](../../practices.html) > [Collecting Data](../../practices.html#collect) > Get Started 

_Asking the right questions to get the right data_

__One of the first things to address around data collection is what your question is or what is the story you&#39;re trying to tell. This will determine which data you need. Data collection could have an impact beyond the objectives of your story and it&#39;s always important to consider the ethical aspect of your data collection before you start (refer to the [Plan &gt; Ethics section](../plan/ethics.html)). __

### Where does your data come from?

How you collect your data will depend on whether you source primary data: data you will collect yourself, secondary data: which you&#39;re collecting from external sources, or both.

One of the key questions when sourcing data externally, is how to [discover the right data](find-data-sources.html) sources and check if they are right for you.

If you&#39;re going to collect data yourself, you&#39;ll need to think about:
How will you [collect data](collect-data.html)? Through interviews, surveys, using online toolsâ€¦

Whether you collect your own data or get it from an external source, you&#39;ll need to think about:
 - How will you [clean up the data](clean-data.html) into a format that&#39;s usable for your purpose?
 - How will you [verify and control the quality of the data](verify-data.html)?
