There are a number of essential practices which most influence mapping project apply along the way. 

## Plan
_When you get started on a project it's usually an intuition or a question that guides you, but to achieve your goals, a little bit of planning goes a long way.

You've found a good place to start! The Influence Mapping Toolbox aims to help people learn about existing influence mapping projects, and to share learning about common practices, tools and project experiences, so that influence mapping as a practice can grow and have even more impact.

Influence mapping is at a stage now where there are many people doing similar work but, because the community is still fragmented, learning is not being shared as effectively or as widely as it could be. 

We have created a resource where the varied expertise and in-depth knowledge of influence mappers can be shared and built upon: a toolbox that will help newcomers and experts to map influence and make the most of their work. 

There are a number of aspects you need to think about before you start your project. But planning is often a continuous and iterative process so we recommend to come back to this section and the questions within it regularly as you progress.

## Collect
_There&#39;s a lot of data out there asking the right questions and knowing when you need to organise your own data collection takes experience.

One of the first things to address around data collection is what your question is or what is the story you're trying to tell. This will determine which data you need. Data collection could have an impact beyond the objectives of your story and it's always important to consider the ethical aspect of your data collection before you start.

<strong>Where does your data come from?</strong>
How you collect your data will depend on whether you source primary data: data you will collect yourself, secondary data: which you're collecting from external sources, or both.

One of the key questions when sourcing data externally, is how to [discover the right data](find-data-sources.html) sources and check if they are right for you.

If you're going to collect data yourself, you'll need to think about:
How will you [collect data](collect-data.html)? Through interviews, surveys, using online tools…

Whether you collect your own data or get it from an external source, you'll need to think about:
How will you [clean up the data](clean-data.html) into a format that's usable for your purpose?
How will you [verify and control the quality of the data](verify-data.html)?

## Organise
_Investigating, analysing and finding more about your problem goes hand in hand with how you organise and structure your data. It determines how your project is experienced by your audience but it will also have a lot of impact on the type of technology you&#39;ll need._

## Publish
_Putting your story out there is when it can be able to create impact. But with data stories, allowing others to build on your result can be the difference between satisfying accolades by your peers and actual real world impact._
