<h1>How to clean up your data?</h1>

Raw data is generally messy. Most projects require a substantial investment in 'cleaning' empty records, duplicates, unidentifiable inputs, and other anomalies that make it harder to discern patterns in the data.

There are a number of resources that can help you understand this process and make it easier to spot problems.

You can also learn more about techniques and tips regarding data cleaning:
- The [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_2.html) has a section on cleaning messy data.
- The [Online Journalism Blog](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/tag/cleaning-data/) also has blog posts on various aspects of data cleaning.
