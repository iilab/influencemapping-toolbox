<h1>How to analyse your data?</h1>

There is no simple or single answer, but there are some useful resources for thinking about how to analyze and visualize data:
 - [This chapter from the Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_4.html)  provides an example of how to approach a dataset with specific queries to support a story.
 - This section on [Telling Stories with Data from Exploring the Invisible Decoding Data Guide](https://exposingtheinvisible.org/guides/decoding-data/#tellingstories) discusses how to search within data to generate stories with integrity.
 - This [article by Moushan Zer-Aviv in Exploring the Invisible Decoding Data Guide](https://exposingtheinvisible.org/guides/decoding-data/#networks) is an excellent critical look at using network visualisation as a means of understanding large datasets.
