Now: Working on a Influence Mapping toolbox

### Problem
**How do I get started with my influence mapping project?**

* How do I → Who is the person we are trying to target?
* get started with my → Whose project is it exactly? it depends if you’re in a startup, media, university.
* influence mapping → 	Say what? Some people don’t relate political or economical influence investigation to the term “influence mapping”
* project? → What kind? Tons of different types of project

### Goals
Practical: How to make, how to practice. It integrates practices and tools by putting the tool use in context of practice.
Accesible: to beginers and more experienced practitioners. Useful for people working by themselves or teams.
Consolidated: Existing and new information in the same place.
Guidance: Practices, tools and projects are analysed and categorized by experts.
State of the art: Curation.

Project started in August 2015 and will launch in December 2015.

Survey was answered by 11 projects/tools.

### Through it and the desk investigation, they came out with these Journey Entry Points:

**Primary**
* “How to identify data for your project?” (Practices/Projects/Tools)
* “How to organise your data?” (Practices/Tools)
* “How to make sense of your data?” (Practices/Tools)
* “How to present your data and findings?” (Practices/Tools)

**Secondary **
* "Take a tour of the tools available" (End User Tools)
* "What are the best approaches to build your own tools?" (Dev Tools)
* “Who’s doing work like yours?” (Projects)
* “Influence mapping success stories” (Case Studies) 
* “Influence mapping essentials” (Practices)

### Would like to get feedback around the Structure:
* Projects: Existing influence mapping project including projects aiming to provide data to others 
* Tools: Include End user tools, such as spreadsheets or online services that don't require development skills 
* Dev Tools: Libraries, Framework, Programming Languages, Database systems… 
* Practices: Activities, tasks (recipes) or methods that are linked to the practice of influence mapping. Different projects have different goals, teams. Good unit on how to drive people when they are thinking on how to improve. 
* Case Studies: Detailed analysis of existing projects in order to help others learn about various concrete practices 
* Guides, Data Providers,...

### Contribute! 
* Give us more feedback about structure 
* Tell us if you want to contribute to the content (manage your project page, your own tool page, share your practices/recipes...) 
* Get in touch if you have colleagues or partners that could test this in beta in about a month or two. influencemapping@iilab.org
