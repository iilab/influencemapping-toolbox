To do a small network map, or a big network map, you need kind of the same coding skills to draw conflicts on people, organizations and power

This is something really important for programmers around here: journalists do not understand what a node and an edge is
We can talk about balls and arrows, and those can be expressed in this way

* Nodes: people and organizaciones
* Arrows: how they connect

We saw a pattern: People that needed data for network visualizations and there are other that need fast visualizations
There’s no much tools that: 

* Democratize the creation of network visualizations by people who don’t know how to code. 
* Build network graph visualizations without programming to publish them in your website.

Good example: Timeline.js

Nodemapper is a tool that you can use without programming, to publish them in their website. It’s designed for small things.
