* Update an old story with fresh data… for free
* Get notified each time some new info about a person becomes available
* Notify me when new data emerge concerning a story I’m reporting
* Data isn’t always perfect, it sometimes needs revision. How does a tool deal with updates of connections?

**Data verification**

* Can any document confirm some rumor I heard elsewhere?
* Is there a newer/older/different version of this document?
* Trust that a document is not a forgery
* Cite source documents in my final story
* See articles that have already been written about a document

**Workflow**

* Toolkit to pilot a structured journalism activity w/in a media house
* Keep track of my research

* Manually go through docs to fill up a spreadsheet
* Work with a dataset that’s too large for Excel
* Sort things
* Count things
* Map out places mentioned in document
* How long is the word that was redacted in this document? 
* Correlate data between different types of media.

**Spreadsheets**

* Better applications where spreadsheet is the interface (i.e. more featureful spreadsheets for enrichment, reconciliation, etc.
* Have template spreadsheets for different story models
* Database look-up from Google Spreadsheets.

**Provenance / Sources**

* Source data linking
* Structuring ad hoc data as a part of the journalism process
* Machine readable provenance for news stories

**Entity, Identification, Matching**

* Match similar entity, allow manual match
* Automated data cleaning tracker - always know the source of your data.
