This Wiki gathers *some* of the knowledge shared in our first conference on **Technology for Investigative Journalism Conference**, which was held at City University, London, September 19-20, 2015. 

The event brought together journalists who specialize in cross-national collaborations and technologists working on tools to support them.

Everyone doing networked investigative reporting faces similar challenges, including access to data, the usability of analysis tools, and the difficulty of determining who knows what among your collaborators. Solving these problems will require a new generation of software, but we will also need to find different ways of working together, and create models for sustained funding. 

The event ended up with some consensus on goals, organization, and technical approaches.

### Sessions, Workshops & Demo sessions

**Saturday, September 19th**
