### Matching criminal patterns in the pre-crime stage

* Crime and corruption is not a local issue, it’s a global issue. Organized crime operates cross-borders. 
Expose and prevent crime from happening. Criminal models can be applied in different countries, they apply the same schemes in different parts of the world.
* Criminals cross borders when they are in absolute trouble, but it hasn’t been noticed by the authorities yet. We can actually stop them before they cross the border, before the crime it’s done in another country.
* We as journalists can pre-crime, prevent the crime before it’s done. We can do it with data, through searching data + sharing crime patterns. You can not just share data, but what you can actually do is share search patters so other people can apply it over their search.
* How? Investigate crime articles and filter the crimes and method.
* OCCRP shares this information with the authorities. 
* This is a way to use data that’s sitting there.
